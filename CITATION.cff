title: "Comparative Study of Random Forest and Gradient-Boosted Trees for Predicting Indonesian Public University Tuition Fees with Multi-Output Quantile and Conformal Prediction"
abstract: |
  This repository contains the code and documentation for a comparative study of tree-based ensemble methods
  (Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM) to predict Indonesian public university tuition fees (UKT)
  across 11 categories using multi-output regression, with uncertainty quantification via quantile regression
  and conformal prediction. The pipeline includes preprocessing, model training, shared-calibration conformal
  prediction, evaluation, and visualization, and is accompanied by publication-ready research documentation.
